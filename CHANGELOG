Changelog:

NodeFuzz version 0.1.6:
-----------------------

External contribution:

Linux ASAN-instrumentation with support for reporting speed and crashes to Grinder.
Contributed by: Ryan Baxendale 

Misc:

Removed some try{...}catch(){...} from moduleLoader.js. Now you get more clear error message,
but you have to be more careful with what you try to load. :)

NodeFuzz version 0.1.5:
-----------------------

Bug fixes: 

- default configuration-file was missing OSX "darwin" branch. Thanks to symeon for informing about this bug.

Features added:

- WebSocket.on('disconnect') 

  Event that is triggered when WebSocket connection between the NodeFuzz and client is disconnected. Useful for performance optimization in situations where instrumentation doesn't detect a crash i.e ASAN and stack overflow(stack exhaustion) (Note: This feature may cause old instrumentation-modules to stop working because websocketTimeout-event is not triggered if the WebSocket-connection gets disconnected )

- feedbackProtocol

  Added new WebSocket subprotocol 'feedback-protocol' for communication between the NodeFuzz and client. This feature allows test case execution analysis on client so that the collected info can be directly delivered to instrumentation/test case generator.
  

- New Config properties
  
  disableDefaultWsOnRequest:
   Boolean to enable/disable the default WebSocket.on('request') handler. (Default: false)
  
  addCustomWebSocketHandler:
   Function that is executed if available during WebSocket-server initialization. Gets WebSocket-server object as an argument. Can be used to change WebSocket-server settings and to create new connection-handlers.
  
  httpRootDir:
   Root directory for the HTTP-server. (Note: Really poor implementation that did the trick in one of my experiments.) 
  
  disableTestCaseBuffer:
   Boolean to enable/disable test case buffer. If enabled this option will disable test case precaching. Implemented for situations like repro-file minimization where the requested test cases depend on execution of previous test case.(Default: false)
 
- Commandline flags changed
  
  -m | --module  - "ModulePath" where to load modules. (Note: can be file or folder)
  -c | --config  - Configuration-file path. (Note: Configuration-file must export config-object)
  -i | --instrumentation  - Instrumentation-module path.
